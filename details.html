<div>Imagine playing a sport you love in front of thousands of people in attendance and millions watching worldwide and represent the school you decided to attend. Now let me ask this how much do you think colleges make off student athletes playing in a championship game or in just a regular season game. College athletes deserve to be paid. There the ones that are busting there butts off on and of the field/court. There the ones that are risking injury or even for some sports death just to entertain the fans of the University.</div>
