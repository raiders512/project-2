<div>The problem for this is college athletes are not getting paid for all the risks they take when they get on the field weather its on or off the field they are always working harder than ever. College athletes deserve to be paid. Their the ones that are working their hardest on and off the field/court. Their the ones that are risking injury or even for some sports death just to entertain the fans of the University.    Now being a student athlete is like having a full time job while still in school. Running around to the court/field, weightroom, film sessions, and classes. The NCAA states that especially during tournaments collegiate athletes must spend extra time practicing or going to the weightroom which makes them miss school. Student athletes are the ones that have to work extra hard whether its on and off the field/court.
Something that we can do is pay this athletes that are working hard on and off the field/court. The NCAA can at least give each of them a certain percent off what they make in just what they sell. The NCAA makes 1 billion dollars off just revenues and your telling me they cant give some of that money to pay there athletes.
I want people to stop letting this just happen being a college athlete is like having a full time job while still in school. All these athletes have to make sure to keep there grades up or else there not able to play and be able to follow there dream which is to play in the proffesional league of whatever sport they play.</div>
