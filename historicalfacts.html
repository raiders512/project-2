<div>Earlier this year North Carolina came on the road to play Duke for a regular season game. The cheapest ticket price was the cost of a ticket to attend the super bowl in Atlanta this year. The cheapest ticket sold for 2,674 and the most expensive ticket sold for 10,652 the craziest part about this is that game sold out.. There are several options we can allow these college athlete that are working hard on and off the court to earn their degree and also play the sport they love. Another fact is that on November 9 the LSU Tigers witch were ranked number 2 in the country played the Alabama Crimson Tide which were ranked number 3 at the time at Alabama. The stadium of Alabama has 92,138 seats this game was as well sold out the cheapest ticke to this game was 250 dollars and the average ticket price sold was 417 dollars imagine how much was the most expensive ticket was and your telling me that these athletes that are working hard cant get at least a little bit of this money.</div>
